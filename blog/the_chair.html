      The Chair
    </h1>

    <p>
      Under the sun </br>
      We had a lot of fun </br>
      After a lot of talk </br>
      I still couldn't walk </br>
      But while we're together, I couldn't care more </br>
      That i'm a massive bore </br>
</br>
      I know that you don't really love me </br>
      I know that that the idea is stupid </br>
      Why oh why cupid </br>
</br>
      Why must you curse in this way </br>
      Why dont I have a say </br>
      Forever bound to this chair </br>
      Never able to repair </br>
</br>
      For this once, have I found the key </br>
      While birds accompany me </br>
      Finally am I able to flee </br>
      To be forever free </br>
