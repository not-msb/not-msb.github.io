      This is a warning! <br>
      The following pages may or may not use JavaScript. You have been warned.
      Personally, I'm disgusted by its name, but sadly, the web has been infected by it.
      This means that I have to use it to produce anything interesting, which is unfortunate.
      I made this warning for whomever may be using a JavaScript-less browser, so that they're aware the pages are infected.
